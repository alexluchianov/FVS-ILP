This repository contains a program that converts the minimum weighted feedback vertex set problem into a integer linear programming one.
The input format is as follows. The first line should contain the number of nodes and the number of edges. The second line should contain the weights of all the nodes. The following m lines should each contain the endpoints of some edge.
The output format is the "lp-format" used by lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/.

The file example.out is generated by running the program with the input from example.in
